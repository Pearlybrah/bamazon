# bamazon

#A nodejs app requiring mySQL databse to simulate an inventory ordering guide. At its basic level it functions well and depletes the selected inventory through the command line prompts. Bamazon uses inquirer to capture the users input and then query's the mySQL database using strict search parameters and updates accordingly.
